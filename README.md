### Built with

### What I learned

I really loved this project as it appears to be easy but it is a bit challenging especially the linear gradient bar. I also loved doing the little triangle and all the other small details that made this design look very beautiful. I learned how to make shapes in CSS and improved my box shadow elements. I am getting better at following design and I improved my HTML and CSS a lot after learning them.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  height: 0;
  width: 0;
  border-bottom: 25px solid transparent;
  border-right: 25px solid white;
}
```
